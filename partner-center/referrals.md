**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

Customers need expertise like yours to help implement solutions with Microsoft products and technologies. We’d like to get you connected.

We often get direct requests for help from customers through our marketing activities and from our internal Microsoft sales agents. Customers also use the **Find a Partner** tool in Partner Center to search for qualified Microsoft partners. 

Grow your business by showcasing your business to these potential customers, and working with them to help them be successful.

*  [Create a marketing profile](create-a-marketing-profile.md). Our sales agents and search tools use these profiles to find appropriate partner businesses with the relevant experience to help our customers.

*  [Respond to referrals](responding-to-referrals.md) When customers express an interest in the contacts you have included in your marketing profile. Learn how to track and quickly respond to these customers.

<!-- 
*  [Analyze your marketing profile](analyze-your-marketing-profile.md) Regularly review and optimize your marketing profile to make sure you’re getting in front of your target customers.
