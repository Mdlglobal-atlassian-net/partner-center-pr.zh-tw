# Cloud Business Applications 

The Cloud Business Applications competency is for partners who specialize in deployment and management of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for their customers.

- [Enterprise Customer Engagement option](#enterprise-customer-engagement-option)
- [Enterprise Operations option](#enterprise-operations-option)

The Cloud Business Applications competency helps you focus and grow your business and close deals. Microsoft Dynamics 365 has a wide range of functional and technical certifications across the Cloud Business Applications competency.  

The functional certifications will prepare your functional roles for the entire solution that you plan to sell, demo, implement, or develop. The solution will not only include the Dynamics 365 business applications but also the entire Microsoft stack including products such as Azure, Office 365 and LinkedIn. When customers use Dynamics 365 they will have the opportunity to use everything that Microsoft has to offer. 

The Cloud Business Applications competency supports partners in having a unique proposition and allows them to differentiate in the marketplace with a choice of functional certifications. The technical certifications will support your technical roles on topics such as customization and configuration as well as deployment and development. 

You can also celebrate your individual employee accomplishments along the way with digital badging which recognizes and differentiates your achievements in real time. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/badges.aspx).
