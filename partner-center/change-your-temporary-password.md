# <a name="change-your-temporary-password"></a>Change your temporary password

**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

Log on to Partner Center and change your temporary password.

As soon as you receive your temporary password from the global admin, log on to Partner Center and change it. If you are an incentives admin, doing so will permit you to complete the migration of your organization’s incentive enrollment. If you are an incentives user, you will then be able to access all your incentives data.

1.  在 **\[儀表板\]** 中，使用您的新使用者識別碼和暫時密碼登入。

2.  When you log in to Partner Center for the first time, you will be prompted to change your password.

If you lose your password, your global admin will need to go to  **Account settings** >**User management** to create a new temporary password for you.
