# <a name="partner-contribution-indicators"></a>合作夥伴貢獻指標

Partner Contribution Indicators (PCI) provides a holistic measure of a partner’s impact in driving successful customer outcomes and therefore greater differentiation in the market when a partner attains and maintains the Cloud Business Applications competency. Partners receive credit for key measures of customer success, such as successful deployments and increasing usage, and are rewarded for continuing to invest in and scale out their technical capabilities.

## <a name="scoring"></a>評分

PCI provides a sophisticated, holistic view of a partner’s technical capabilities, their ability to drive customer success, and their sales performance. PCI measures your company’s prior-year performance across seven key indicators:

1. **Net new revenue** — Net new revenue across all sales channels for Microsoft Dynamics 365 products.
2. **Net customer adds** — Net customers acquired for Dynamics 365 across all sales channels.
3. **Functional consultants** — Number of individuals holding a currently active Functional Consultant Associate certification for Dynamics 365.
4. **Functional consultant growth** — Growth in the number of Functional Consultant Associates since March 31, 2020.
5. **Developers** — Number of individuals holding a currently active Developer Associate certification for Dynamics 365.
6. **New large deployments** — Number of production tenants that cross the high-usage threshold over the past 12 months.
7. **Monthly active user growth** — Growth in monthly active users across all your customers over the past 12 months.

Points are granted for each achieved indicator, resulting in a single-number PCI score. 100 maximum points are possible. PCI score determines competency eligibility:

Each indicator brings a score that is added to the total. Here are the maximum scores for each indicator:

### <a name="thresholds"></a>閾值

每個 PCI 計量都有 Microsoft 設定的閾值，決定您公司可以獲得的最高分。 客戶參與和財務與營運的這些閾值有所不同。 在已開發市場中經營的合作夥伴，與只在新興市場中經營的合作夥伴，其閾值也不同。 如果合作夥伴在已開發市場中有一或多個客戶，則適用已開發市場閾值。 The developed or emerging market categorization of a country is based on the [Microsoft Partner Network definitions](https://assets.microsoft.com/MPN-developed-and-emerging-countries-list.pdf).

Points across each metric are tallied to yield a distinct PCI score for Customer Engagement and Finance & Operations which will be updated monthly.

如果合作夥伴達到或超過以下所示的閾值，就能獲得給定計量的最高分。 除了「功能諮詢人員成長」外，所有計量都是可以獲得部分分數的，例如，「新的淨收入」為 $150,000 的已開發市場合作夥伴，將會獲得最高分 10 分的一半 ($150,000/$300,000)。

## <a name="customer-to-partner-association"></a>客戶對合作夥伴關聯性

You receive credit for Net new revenue, Net customer adds, New large deployments, and Monthly active user growth for a given customer, within the bounds of the metric definition, only if you are the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR), or Digital Partner of Record (DPOR) for a paid subscription belonging to the customer's tenant.

A partner becomes the CPOR if they have established association with a customer at the subscription level via the Dynamics 365 [Online Solution Advisor](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501560/online-services-advisor-osa-sell-incentives-faq) (OSA) incentive or Dynamics 365 [Online Services Usage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3082044/become-eligible-for-the-online-services-usage-incentive-program) (OSU) incentive.

如果合作夥伴已在產品內與客戶在訂用帳戶層級建立關聯性，就會成為 DPOR。

當給定訂用帳戶的 CPOR 與 DPOR 都存在時，CPOR 會收到與訂用帳戶相關聯之 PCI 計量的所有信用額度。
