Usage-based pricing is dynamic and changes frequently. Examples of usage-based services include Microsoft Azure.

For more information about which offers and product bundles are available to sell within these product families, see the CSP offer matrix on the **Pricing and offers** page, available from your **Dashboard** menu.
