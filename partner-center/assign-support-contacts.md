**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

When you set up subscriptions for Microsoft services for your customers, you may want to assign the technical support for these products to a designated product reseller, rather than providing the support yourself.

After you set up support contacts, customers see your assigned support contact's information on the product support pages. For example, when Office customers need support, they can go into the Office.com page, log in with their admin credentials, select the **Admin** tile, and under the **Support** section, see the assigned support contact information.

This can be used for [multi-partner](multipartner.md) and [multi-channel](multichannel.md) scenarios.

1.  Start by [requesting a relationship](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md) with your designated product reseller. Negotiate a support agreement with them for handling technical support.

2.  From the Partner Center Dashboard, select **Customers**, then select a customer, then select a subscription, for example, Office 365 Business Premium.

3.  In  **Designated support contact**, select the designated product reseller, and then click **Submit**. 

    Notes: 
    
    *  For new subscriptions, the designated support contact defaults to the indirect provider. 您可以將此預設值變更為擁有委派管理員權限的間接經銷商。
    
    *  If your reseller's name doesn't appear in the list of available support contacts, add them in by [requesting a relationship](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md). After the relationship is established, they should appear in the list.  

4.  Review that the changes are correct, and then select **Close**.
