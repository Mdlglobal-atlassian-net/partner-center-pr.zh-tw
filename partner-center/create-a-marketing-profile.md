# <a name="create-a-marketing-profile"></a>Create a marketing profile

**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

As a qualified Microsoft partner, you can create a marketing profile to showcase your business to customers who are looking for your unique solutions and expertise to address their business needs.

Microsoft engages millions of customers every year through marketing, sales and service efforts. Most of these engagements create opportunities for us to provide referrals to our partners in the form of sales leads. 

As the first step to getting these leads, create a marketing profile. We'll show your profile to customers who are searching for partners who can help them implement Microsoft products and solutions, through:

*  **The [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) search experience**. Potential customers can search partner listings on their own to locate partners who meet their search criteria. 
*  **Referrals from Microsoft sales and service employees**. Potential customers interested in deploying cloud-based technology solutions contact Microsoft for help finding professionals who can meet their business needs. These Microsoft professionals can then refer potential customers to your company.

**Pinpoint 和 C2PC**：我們即將合併這些工具到合作夥伴中心。 If you’ve used these tools in the past, create a new marketing profile in Partner Center to continue to generate and manage your sales leads. Note, we don’t currently support importing profiles from the previous sites. 

## <a name="create-a-profile"></a>Create a profile

Create profiles for each region you are authorized to do business in. 

1.  Log into [Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=808956) using a [global admin or admin agent account](create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions.md).

2.  從 **\[儀表板\]** 功能表，選取 **\[轉介\]** &gt; **\[檢視行銷設定檔\]** &gt; 選取國家/地區 > **[建立行銷設定檔](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/publishing)**。

3.  在 **\[建立行銷設定檔\]** 頁面中，選取地區，然後輸入您的設定檔資訊。
    
    Note, while Partner Center supports multiple languages, some elements such as the description and free-form tags may need to include text from different languages, as noted in this topic.

### <a href="" id="partner_info"></a>Partner information

Introduce your company, adding a logo and a brief description, and a link to your website. 

The logo can be a GIF, JPG, or PNG file, with a maximum width of 300 pixels. We recommend using square or long aspect ratios. Tall aspect ratios are not recommended.

Your description can be up to 1000 characters. Tips for a great description: 

*  **Be brief**, leading with what’s important in the first sentence or two. This should be the headline that catches customers’ attention. In the Find a partner search experience, we show the first line or two in the search results preview.
*  **Focus on your company’s experiences with Microsoft-specific offerings**. Customers searching for referrals are generally looking for partners with Microsoft-specific experience.
*  **Use bullets**. Break up information into bulleted lists to make it easier to scan.
*  **Avoid jargon**. Use simple, everyday language, naming your offerings for what they do: the business needs they address, or task or objective they help customers accomplish.
*  **Don’t worry about filling the description with search keywords**. The customer search tools search for keywords generated in the Partner Expertise section, not the description.
*  **Keep your profile current**. With each software or service release, update your profile, keeping it in sync with your company's website.
*  **Do not refer to another Microsoft partner company by name**, unless it is a subsidiary or is otherwise affiliated with your company, or you have a current agreement with that partner company to act in partnership and/or promote each other for shared work opportunities.
*  **For regions with multiple languages**, consider including text from multiple languages in the description.

### <a name="partner-expertise"></a>Partner expertise

[尋找合作夥伴] 搜尋工具會尋找專長標籤。 最佳化這些標籤以協助提高您的設定檔可見度。

Start by adding your own tags into the Partner Expertise section. Tags you can add: 

*  **Industry focus tags**. Up to 5 industries
*  **Products**. Limited to Microsoft products
*  **Service type** 
*  **Solutions, skills, and capabilities**. These tags are free-form, and provide you the ability to add search keywords that are unique to your capabilities.

Other tags used in search:
*  **Competency tags** are an earned designation showcasing your company’s capabilities.
*  **Endorsement tags** are earned when Microsoft or your customers who have worked with you endorse your work.

#### <a href="" id="#allow_us_to_endorse_areas_of_expertise"></a>Allow Microsoft to endorse my areas of expertise

建議您讓這個設定保持已核取狀態。 

當您透過合作夥伴中心證明您在拓展客戶方面取得成效，或是參與其他 Microsoft 認證或計畫時，我們將會自動加入背書，認可您的特定產品、服務與產業促使獲得該項成功。 背書是搜尋結果的重要因素。

如果您所提供服務的產品是您不希望在設定檔中顯露的產品，則可以取消核取此方塊，並手動管理您的設定檔。 These endorsements will be hidden from your customers view, but you can add them back to your profile later at any time.

### <a name="customer-preferences"></a>Customer preferences

#### <a href="" id="#target_size"></a>Target size

You can opt out of referrals from businesses that don’t meet your target customer size.

By opting out, you’ll have more time to spend on businesses that are a match for the businesses that you prefer to work with.

### <a href="" id="#locations"></a> Locations

每個地區最多可以新增 5 個在您組織中排名居前的位置。 These locations appear when customers search for partners by proximity. 

Indicate locations that are official company locations and can be validated. Pick locations that are central to the markets you serve, and best represent your company’s ability to fulfill.

完成更新位置資訊時，選取 **\[儲存此位置\]** 或 **\[儲存此位置後，再新增其他位置\]** (即使您只是新增一個位置)。

您新增的每個位置都會變成不同的設定檔頁面。 更新設定檔頁面時，請確定您已針對每個位置更新這些頁面。

若要更新位置的地址，您必須先**刪除**位置，再重新將其加入。

如果您在排名最前面的 5 個位置，但想要變更其中一個位置時，請先**刪除**現有的位置，再加入新的位置。

## <a name="review-your-profile"></a>檢閱您的設定檔

After you publish your profile, updates appear in the [Find a partner](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search) searches within 24 hours. 

## <a name="improve-the-visibility-of-your-profile"></a>Improve the visibility of your profile 

*  **[Respond quickly to requests](responding-to-referrals.md)**. When you receive a customer referral, a faster response can lead to better results on the search pages for future customers.
*  **Be selective with your tags**.  It’s better to have fewer tags that best represent your company’s offers, solutions, value propositions, and unique position where you can consistently demonstrate success.  That will pay dividends in future search results.
*  **Earn competency tags** through Microsoft to demonstrate your proficiency in our products.
*  **Earn endorsement tags** from customers who appreciate your work.
