This topic explains how to make sure that you are credited for withholding tax in Partner Center. It explains how to open a service request using the global withholding tax form or the withholding tax form for Germany.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft must receive your **withholding tax credit form** and a copy of your **withholding tax certificate** for your account to be credited for withholding tax.

## <a name="withholding-tax-credit-form"></a>Withholding tax credit form

- Ensure the form includes your company name and country, the withholding tax certificate number, and the form is signed and dated accurately. Here are the tax credit forms: For [Germany](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE305Lo) and [All other countries](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE30311).

The withholding tax credit form provides Microsoft with the following information:

- Invoice(s)
- Amount paid to Microsoft
- 扣繳稅賦金額
- Withholding tax percentage
- Type of payment
- Company that was paid (if other than Microsoft)

- Once you have this information ready, create the service request.

You'll need to fill out your **withholding tax credit form** before creating your support request. You will include this form with your support request.

Fill out the appropriate form for your country or region:

- [**Global withholding tax credit form**](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE30311) (all countries, excluding Germany)
- [**Germany withholding tax credit form**](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE305Lo)

Make sure that your form is accurate before submitting it to Microsoft:

1. Select the **question mark** **(?)** in the uppor right corner of your dashboard in Partner Center.

2. Select **CSP**.

3. Under **CSP - billing and payments**, select the issue type - **Withholding tax** and select **Yes**. 

4. When you submit the service request be sure to attach the tax credit form and digital copies of the tax certificates.

5. If you are submitting a non-English tax certificate via an English service request, a translation of the tax certificate is required.

6. We will contact you directly by email or phone.

- Include your **company name** and **country** on the form.
- Accurate **sign** and **date** the form.
- Record the proper **withholding tax amount percentage** on the form, based on your local tax authority's information.
- Make sure that the **total amount** on the form matches the totals from the invoices you are submitting.

## <a name="include-withholding-tax-certificates"></a>Include withholding tax certificates

The tax certificates should be for Microsoft invoices only. If there are other companies included in the certificates, please specify the amount so that we can exclude it in our internal processing, but still have full visibility to what the total certificates include. 

You'll need to include a **digital copy** of your **withholding tax certificates** along with your support request. You received this certificate from your local tax agency when you submitted your request in Partner Center.

The total in the withholding tax certificate must match the supporting detail in the withholding tax credit form.

Fill out the [withholding tax credit form](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE305Lo) completely and send it along with the scanned copy of the Withholding Tax Certificate upon submission of your request in Partner Center or your Azure/O365/CRM/Intune Portal. 

If you are submitting a **non-English language tax certificate** through an **English language service request**, you must include a **translation** of the tax certificate.

The tax certificates should be for **Microsoft invoices only**. If you have **other companies** that the certificates include, specify the amount such that we can exclude the amount in our internal processing, but still have full visibility to what the total certificates include.
