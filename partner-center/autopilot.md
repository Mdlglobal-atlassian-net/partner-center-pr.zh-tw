# <a name="simplify-device-setup-with-windows-autopilot"></a>Simplify device setup with Windows Autopilot 

Windows Autopilot streamlines and secures device setup for new Windows 10 Pro devices from first boot in only a few steps. To learn more, see [Overview of Windows AutoPilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-auto-pilot).

## <a name="features"></a>Features

*  **Disable local administrator permissions** for the end users setting up devices
*  **Show an organization's login page**. The organization can predefine a logon page that adds the device as a work device, and joins the device with Azure Active Directory.
*  **Enroll the device into a Mobile Device Manager (MDM)**, for example: Microsoft Intune, after OOBE is complete.
*  **Streamline the out-of-box experience (OOBE)** to use just the steps and decisions required, using a Windows AutoPilot Deployment profile. 

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

*  已預先安裝 Windows 10 專業版 Creators Update (1703 版或更新版本) 或 Windows 10 Pro for Advanced PCs 的裝置。
*  Device identifier known as a hardware hash (128 HWH or 4k HWH), which is typically provided by an OEM. You'll use identifiers to assign organization profiles in Partner Center. 2017 年 9 月之後，您將不再需要硬體雜湊。 
*  The devices must have access to the internet. When the device can’t connect, it shows the default Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE) screens.
*  Enrolling the device into an MDM requires Azure Active Directory Premium.

## <a name="add-organization-login-pages-to-oobe"></a>Add organization login pages to OOBE

To add organization-specific pages, add the devices into your organization’s [Azure AD directory](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848958) and create login pages.

   *  Automatically select setup for work or school
   *  Skip Cortana, OneDrive, and OEM registration setup pages

### <a name="add-devices-and-apply-a-profile"></a>Add devices and apply a profile

In Partner Center, you can create a Windows AutoPilot deployment profile and apply it to a list of the devices.

To configure devices, upload a list of the devices into Partner Center, create a profile that applies to the devices, and apply it.

1.  Add the list of devices into Partner Center.

    銷售代理人和系統管理代理人擁有將裝置清單新增至合作夥伴中心的存取權限。
    
    間接經銷商可以和他們的間接提供者合作來新增這份清單。

    a.  Create a .csv file using the PowerShell script from the topic: [Overview of Windows AutoPilot](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-auto-pilot). This .csv file contains device info including the serial number, OEM name, model name, product ID and device identifier. 

    b.  From the Partner Center dashboard, go to **Customers** > select the customer that’s receiving the devices > **Devices > Add devices**.

    c.  Name the batch of devices, for example, “Contoso Sales Department PCs – April 2017 order.” 

    d.  Click **Browse** > select the device info file > **Validate**.

    **Note:** If you get an error message after trying to upload the .csv file, check the format of the file. After August, you can use the Hardware Hash only, or the OEM name, serial number, and model in that column order, or the Windows Product ID. You can also use the sample .csv file provided from the link next to **Add devices**.

2.  Create a profile that you can apply to the devices. (Only admin agents have access to create and apply profiles in Partner Center.)

    a.  From **Devices**, click **Add new profile**.

    b.  Name the profile, for example, “Contoso Desktop Profile – Skip All OOBE”.

    c.  Configure the OOBE settings. For example, check **Skip Express Settings in setup**.

    d.  Click **Submit**.

3.  Apply the profile.

    a.  From **Devices**, in the **Assign and delete devices** pane, select the devices that you want to configure. To select an entire batch, click the checkbox next to the batch name (for example, “Contoso Sales Department PCs – March 2017 order”).

    b.  Click **Apply profile**, and select the profile (for example, “Contoso Desktop Profile – Skip All OOBE”). The devices will show the profile in the Profile column.

4.  Optional: Test to see that your profile works.

    a.  Connect a device to the network, and turn it on.

    b.  Verify that the appropriate OOBE screens (if any) appear.

    c.  To prepare the device for a new user, complete the OOBE experience, then reset the device to its factory default settings.


## <a name="to-update-or-delete-a-profile"></a>To update or delete a profile 

Once you’ve assigned a profile to a device, you can update it, even if you’ve already given the device to your customer. When the device connects to the internet, it downloads the latest version of your profile during the OOBE process. If your customer restores their device to its factory default settings, the device will again download the latest updates to your profile. 

### <a name="you-can-remove-a-profile-from-a-device"></a>You can remove a profile from a device
1. Select the device (or batch of devices) you want to remove the profile from. 

2. In **Assign and delete devices** pane, select **Remove profile**.

3. Go to the profile you want to remove and delete it. The profile will be deleted from all devices.

From **Devices**, select the profile. From here, you can modify the existing settings.
