**適用於**

-  合作夥伴中心

As a qualified Microsoft partner, you have the opportunity to co-sell with Microsoft. This collaboration helps you take solutions to market, drive joint revenue, and ensure customer success.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To co-sell with Microsoft, partners need a commercial-ready solution, an engaged sales team, and a strong go-to-market strategy. They must also meet specific additional criteria. For more info, see [Become co-sell ready](https://partner.microsoft.com/reach-customers/selling-with-microsoft#become-ready).

## <a name="invite-microsoft-to-collaborate-on-an-engagement"></a>Invite Microsoft to collaborate on an engagement

Once you've been approved to co-sell with Microsoft, you'll have the option to invite Microsoft to collaborate on specific engagements.

To invite Microsoft to collaborate on an engagement, go to **Referrals > Engagements > Sent** and select **Create an engagement**. Then, complete the following steps.

### <a name="select-your-customer"></a>Select your customer

You will need to identify the customer for this specific engagement. Enter their name and location and then select **Search**. Since many companies have more than one business entity in the same location, you may see multiple results. If you're not sure which to choose, you can confirm which [D-U-N-S Number](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html) belongs to your customer. Be sure to select the exact match for the customer who you're working with. 

Once you click **Select**, you'll be prompted to enter the name, phone number, and email address for the person who's your main point of contact for this engagement. After you've entered this info, select **Next**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure that you have obtained sufficient consent to provide the customer's contact information to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this info to contact the customer directly.

### <a name="define-your-engagement"></a>Define your engagement

On the next screen, you'll need to provide details about the engagement for which you want to co-sell with Microsoft.

In the **Engagement details** section, enter the following:
- **Engagement name**: Enter a name that describes this customer and engagement. The Microsoft team will see this name when reviewing your engagement details, so be sure to use clear and professional language.
- **CRM ID**: If desired, enter the ID number you're using in your CRM system.
- **Estimated close date**: The approximate date when you expect to close this deal.
- **Estimated value**: The total expected value for the engagement. 請務必選取適當的貨幣。

In the **Notes** field, explain what the customer is interested in and how your solution could help them.

 Next, in the **Partner contact** section, enter the name, phone number, and email for the main contact at your company who is working on this engagement.

Finally, in the **Add solutions** section, select the solution that will be used for the engagement. 如果您沒看到正確的解決方案列出，請連絡支援人員。

Select **Next** to move on to the next step.

### <a name="invite-others"></a>Invite others

The final step in the co-sell engagement creation process is to provide more details about the type of help you're looking for. Select the best fit under **How can we help you?** Then, in the **Notes to Microsoft** field, provide as much detail as possible about the best ways for Microsoft to provide assistance.

Be sure to check the box confirming that you have obtained sufficient consent from your partner. When everything's ready, select **Create engagement.** After that, Microsoft will reach out to you, using the contact info you provided for **Partner contact**.

## <a name="viewing-your-sent-engagements"></a>Viewing your sent engagements

Co-sell engagements that you have sent to Microsoft can be seen by going to **Referrals > Engagements > Sent**. Here you'll see all of the referrals which have been sent to Microsoft, along with the deadline for Microsoft to accept the invitation.

If Microsoft accepts the engagement, it will be moved to **Active**. Working with Microsoft, you'll need to work to close the deal with the customer. See [Respond to referrals](responding-to-referrals.md) for more info. If Microsoft does not accept the engagement, it will be moved to **Archived**.
