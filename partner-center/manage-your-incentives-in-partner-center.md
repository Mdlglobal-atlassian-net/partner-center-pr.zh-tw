Now that Partner incentives management is available in Partner Center, you can sign up for incentives, access your tax and payment profiles, access your earnings and payment statements, and manage users – all here in Partner Center. 

Beginning with already enrolled Partners, we are enabling partners to manage incentives in Partner Center in phases starting in July. Look out for an email from us letting you know that it is time to set up your organization for incentives in Partner Center. 

Admins, if you have received the email, follow these three easy steps today:

1.  登入合作夥伴中心 
2.  依照電子郵件中的指示，設定您的獎勵使用者 
3.  將合作夥伴中心登入認證提供給您新近設定的獎勵使用者

When the Incentive Admin has received credentials, they can complete the migration of your organization which will enable your organization to manage your incentives here – in Partner center.
