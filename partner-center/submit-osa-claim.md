**適用於**

-  合作夥伴中心


On October 1, 2019, Microsoft began using the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR) model to manage the associations you have with your Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 customers with regards to the Online Services Advisory (OSA) Sell, Online Services Usage (OSU)-Microsoft 365 and OSU-Business Application incentives.

When you submit your claim, Microsoft validates it. We may ask you for more information at this point. We'll also notify the customer of your association request. Customers have five business days to opt out. If they don't opt out, your association with this specific tenant and workload will be official. At this point you'll have access to the customer's usage data. 

You'll need the following information to complete a claim:

- The **MPN ID** for your entity that makes the claim

- Customer's **domain name** [Find this](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/find-customer-domain-name)

- Customer's **Directory ID** or **Tenant ID** [Find this](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/find-customer-domain-name)

- The **Solution area**, such as Business Applications or Microsoft 365

- The **Activity** you have performed and the type of claim you want to make, such as Pre-sales, Usage, or Revenue association

- Your customer's **Contact name**, title, and email address

- For Dynamics 365, you also need to provide your customer's **Technical contact** name, title, and email address

- Your own company's **Contact name** and email address

- You'll create a **Name** for this claim

- The **Product(s)** or workload(s) you're claiming

- **Proof of execution (POE)** , such as a statement of work signed by the customer. You can also download a POE template to use.

- For partners claiming revenue association only: **Dynamics solution seller name**, **Customer name**, and **Name of ISV product/solution**. 

You should also understand the following points:
- If you have existing Microsoft 365 customers, you'll need to re-associate with those you want to continue to earn OSU incentives by using this process.
- If you have existing associations with Dynamics 365 or Power BI customers, these associations will remain valid, until the expiration of their subscriptions.
- A customer can have multiple partners, but each workload (for OSU-Microsoft 365) or subscription (for OSA-Sell and OSU-Business Applications) can only be associated with one partner.
