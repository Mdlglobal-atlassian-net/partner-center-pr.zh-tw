The **Business profile insights** page in Partner Center lets you see how well you're capturing the attention of your target customers and generating referrals.

To see your referral insights data, from the Partner Center menu, go to **Referrals > Business profile insights**. 您的資料會顯示設定檔績效、分析趨勢，以及辨識需要有所動作的區域。

Near the top of the **Business profile insights** page, you can select the time period for which you want to show data. The default selection is **30D** (30 days), but you can choose to show data for a period of 3 or 6 months instead. Data for all regions is included.

After you post your company's [business profile](create-a-marketing-profile.md), you'll start to see data on how many customers find your profile, how often they click through to learn more, and how often they send you requests for information (RFIs). Use this data when refining your business profiles to generate more leads, and more relevant leads.

The **Profile performance summary** chart includes the following info for the selected time period:

- **Search results**: Info about the search terms that customers are using to find your business profile.
- **Page views**: The total number of times that customers viewed your business profile.
- **Contact clicks**: The total number of times that customers selected your business profile from the [Find a solution provider](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home) page.
- **Referrals generated**: The total number of referrals sent to you after a customer selected your business profile.

> [!TIP]
> As you start to [respond to these referrals](responding-to-referrals.md), be sure to review the [Referral insights page](referral-insights.md) to see more details on how your referrals are performing.
