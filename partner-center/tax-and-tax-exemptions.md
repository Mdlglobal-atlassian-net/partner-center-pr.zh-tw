# <a name="taxes-and-tax-exemptions"></a>稅金與免稅

適用於：

- 合作夥伴中心
- Microsoft Cloud for US Government 適用的合作夥伴中心

The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program is a sales channel focused on partner resale of products. As a result, Microsoft is not always required to charge sales tax on partner invoices. The rules vary by country and/or region. You can review [country-specific and region-specific details for tax exemptions](#country-and-region-tax-details).

Partners should work with their tax advisor to [file tax exemptions](#file-tax-exemptions) based on their locations and where their customers are based.

## <a name="country-and-region-tax-details"></a>Country and region tax details

Specific tax-related information is available for the following countries and regions: [Canada](#canada), [the European Union](#european-union), [South Africa](#south-africa), [Turkey](#turkey), and [the United States](#united-states). For Taiwan and Korea, see [tax receipts details](#tax-receipts-and-daf).

If you're in another country or region that charges taxes, see [the information for other regions](#other-regions).

For additional questions, [request support in Partner Center](#support).

### <a name="canada"></a>加拿大

大部分經銷商不能於 GST/HST/QST 免稅。 Consult your tax advisor to determine whether you are qualified for exemption, and what documentation you should provide to Microsoft.

For a BC PST Exemption, file a tax exemption as described. 提供您的 BC PST 編號，或完整且簽署過的 *Certificate of Exemption General*。

### <a name="european-union"></a>歐盟

在歐盟會員國內，合作夥伴必須提供其有效加值稅識別碼編號，以供反向徵收和適當的計費。 The VAT number must be accepted as valid.

Microsoft does not support credit and re-bill. Before you sell any subscriptions, you must [register your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md) in Partner Center.

### <a name="south-africa"></a>南非

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in South Africa. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="turkey"></a>土耳其

Microsoft now applies the standard VAT on digital content and services purchased by partners in Turkey. To exclude the VAT from your invoices and manage this yourself, you must update your partner billing profile by [sending Microsoft your VAT ID number](organization-tax-info.md).

### <a name="united-states"></a>美國

在美國的所有經銷商都應該在接受《Microsoft 經銷商合約》之後的 30 天內提供減免營業稅文件。 每個州針對銷售有不同的免稅憑證。 請諮詢您的稅務顧問，以判斷與您登記地址和州籍相關的重要事項。

This may include resale exemption certificates that work across multiple states such as the *Streamline Sales* and *Use Tax Agreement Certificate of Exemption* or the *MTC Uniform Sales & Use Tax Exemption Certificate*.

### <a name="other-regions"></a>其他地區

If you are in another country or region that charges taxes, [request support in Partner Center](#support) for your questions.

## <a name="tax-receipts-and-daf"></a>Tax receipts and DAF

報核聯 (適用於台灣或韓國) 或 DAF 通常在發票產生後需要兩周的作業時間。
