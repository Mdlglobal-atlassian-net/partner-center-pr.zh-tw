# <a name="set-an-azure-spending-budget-for-your-customers"></a>為客戶設定 Azure 消費預算

適用於：

- 合作夥伴中心

You can [set a monthly Azure spending budget for your customers](#set-azure-spending-budget) in Partner Center. This helps your customers manage their Azure spending. This option allows you to compare your customers' Azure spending to the budget during the month. It also helps your customers budget their Azure spending so their monthly bill isn't higher than they anticipate.


> [!NOTE]  
> This feature is not available in sandbox or Test in Production (TIP) accounts.

After you [set an Azure spending budget for your customer(s)](#set-azure-spending-budget), you can also review customer usage in the following ways. These options may help you spot misconfigured services or unusual trends that might suggest fraud. You can then work with your customer(s) to identify the root cause and manage costs. If necessary, you can also [change the customer's budget](#set-azure-spending-budget) to a higher amount.

- [Check current Azure spending](#check-current-azure-spending)

You can also [remove an Azure spending budget](#remove-azure-spending-budget) for customer(s) at any time.
