To manage a customer's service or subscription on their behalf, the customer must grant you administrator permissions for that service. To get administrator permissions from a customer, email them a reseller relationship request. After the customer approves your request, you'll be able to log on to the service's admin portal and manage the service on the customer's behalf.

1.  Select **Customers** from your **Dashboard** menu and then select **Request a reseller relationship**.

2.  On the next page, review the draft email message. You can open the draft message in your default email application or you can copy the message to your clipboard and paste it into an email. 

    You can edit the text in the email, but be sure to include the link as it is personalized to link the customer directly to your account. Select **Done** when you’ve completed this step.

3.  Send the email to your customer.

4.  After the customer accepts your invitation, they'll appear on your **Customers** page, and you'll be able to provision and manage the service for the customer from there.

 >**Note**<br>
    In a multi-channel scenario, only one partner can have administrator permissions to manage a service on the customer's behalf. 

5.  To manage the customer’s account, services, users, and licenses, expand the customer’s record by selecting the down arrow near their name.


>**Important**<br>
Customers can reassign or remove administrator permisions in a service's admin portal. However, unless and until you renegotiate your agreement with the customer, you continue to be responsible for providing customer support and adhering to the terms of the Cloud Reseller Agreement, even after a customer reassigns or removes administrator permissions. In this situation, if the customer requires help, you can call Microsoft support to open a service request on behalf of the customer.
