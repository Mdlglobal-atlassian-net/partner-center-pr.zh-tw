# <a name="read-your-bill"></a>閱讀您的帳單

適用於：

- 合作夥伴中心
- Microsoft Cloud for US Government 適用的合作夥伴中心

Your **invoice** is a **summary of all your Partner Center charges** (across the program, all products, and all customers) for the **current billing period**.

## <a name="invoice-types"></a>Invoice types

You will receive one invoice for any license-based charges (such as Office 365) and usage-based charges (such as Azure).

You will receive a separate invoice for one-time charges (such as Azure reserved VM instances).

## <a name="invoice-file-fields"></a>Invoice file fields

For a detailed description of all the fields in your invoice file (including fields for one-time charges), see [Invoice file fields](invoice-file.md).

## <a name="find-your-bill"></a>Find your bill

You can find your invoice on the **Billing** page of the dashboard in Partner Center. You can also find your billing history, spending trends, and reconciliation files on this page.

1. Sign in to the dashboard in Partner Center.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Billing**.
3. On the **Billing** page, select the invoice you want to download.
    - You can find a link to your latest invoice at the top of the page under **Account balance as of last invoice date**.
    - You can find previous invoices in the **Billing history** section. Choose the appropriate year, then select the drop-down arrow next to the appropriate **Billing period**. You can select the link next to **Invoices (.pdf)** to download that period's invoice.

## <a name="understand-billing-periods"></a>Understand billing periods

Your invoice is available within **two (2) days** of your selected billing date in **UTC time**.

For example, if you have a September 12th monthly billing date:

- The invoice generation process will **begin** at 12:00AM UTC on September 13th.
- The invoice generation process will **complete** by 12:00AM UTC on September 14th.
- If you do not see your invoice by 11:59PM UTC on September 15th, you’re out of your Service Level Agreement (SLA) and should file a service request.

### <a name="csp-monthly-billing"></a>CSP monthly billing

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program who have chosen to be billed monthly pay Microsoft 60 days in arrears for their customers' subscriptions (both license-based and usage-based subscriptions).

## <a name="find-itemized-details-for-charges"></a>Find itemized details for charges

You can understand itemized details about your charges using your reconciliation files. The reconciliation files include customer identifiers and subscription identifiers that you can use to create customer invoices.
