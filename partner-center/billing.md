**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

-  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany

As a Cloud Solution Provider partner, you will pay Microsoft 60 days in arrears for the license-based and usage-based subscriptions of your customers.

For your bill, go to the **Dashboard** menu, then select **Billing**. This billing page shows your billing history and trend, the balance due for the current month, links to your invoice and reconciliation files, and your most recent payment.

-   Microsoft doesn't have any requirements or conditions about how you handle your own invoicing.
-   To determine customers' usage, use the customer ID/name and other relevant fields within the reconciliation files.
-   Add your own fees and charges for services and products that you provide.
-   Send a single bill for all charges to your customer.
