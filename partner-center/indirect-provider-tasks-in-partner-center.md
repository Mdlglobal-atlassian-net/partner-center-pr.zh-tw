With such a complex and rapidly changing technology marketplace, customers want the competitive edge that technology solutions can give them. In such a climate, it makes sense for partners to invest in partner-to-partner engagement to extend offerings and enable customers to do even more.

New resellers are entering the market and seeking ways to offer their solutions to customers outside of their markets and locales. As an established technology provider, you're well-positioned to be their route to market. Partner with indirect resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program to connect with other partners, bring new solutions to the market, and advance customers’ adoption of cloud services.

In the indirect provider-reseller (two-tier) model, you partner with indirect resellers to offer Microsoft cloud solutions to customers. You purchase products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and then offer these solutions to customers through your resellers. 

As an indirect provider, you use Partner Center to:

-   Connect with indirect resellers who can help expand your reach and customer base
-   Establish partnerships with indirect resellers that allow you both to serve common customers
-   Designate indirect resellers to manage specific customers and subscriptions 
-   Manage your relationships with Microsoft, customers, and indirect resellers all in one place
-   設法列入 [Microsoft 官方間接提供者清單](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/en-us/partner/find-a-provider)

After you complete these steps, you can manage your reseller partnerships on the **Indirect resellers** page from your **Dashboard** menu.

## <a name="connect-with-indirect-resellers"></a>Connect with indirect resellers

To interact and transact with indirect resellers in Partner Center, you must establish a partnership with them. Having a partnership with an indirect reseller allows you and the reseller to both serve common customers.

To establish a partnership, email a partnership request to the reseller. Be sure to have the reseller’s email address on hand before you get started. 

1. Select **Indirect resellers** from your **Dashboard** menu. 

2. On the **Indirect resellers** page, select **Request a partnership**. A draft email message appears.

3. Select **Open in email** to open the message in your default email application, or select **Copy to clipboard** to copy and then paste the message into an email. Select **Done** when finished.

   >**Important** You can edit the text in the email message, but be sure to include the link as it is personalized for your Partner Center account.

4. After the reseller accepts your partnership request, they’ll appear in your indirect resellers list, and you’ll be able to: 

    -   Add new customers on their behalf
    -   Submit orders on behalf of their customers 
    -   Associate them with a subscription so they can manage it on behalf of the customer who purchased it
    -   Designate them as the customer’s support contact for specific subscriptions

Depending on the level of access and involvement you want the reseller to have, you may want to take one or more of the actions described below.

| **To accomplish this** | **Do this** | **Where** |
|   ------------------   |   -------   |   -----   |
| Enable the reseller to manage a customer’s account and have administrator permissions to manage their subscriptions | Associate a reseller to a customer account when adding a new customer | On the **New customer** page |
| Give the reseller credit for incentives | Associate the reseller to the subscription (new or existing) | On the **New subscription** page |
| Delegate customer support for specific subscriptions to the reseller | Select the reseller from the **Designated support contact** list | On the subscription’s detail page: Select the customer from your **Customers** page, then select the subscription from the customer’s **Subscriptions** page |


## <a name="connect-with-customers"></a>Connect with customers

When you get new customers, you need to create accounts for them in Partner Center. When you add a new customer account, you can designate a specific reseller to manage the account and administer the customers’ subscriptions and services on their behalf. 

When you associate a reseller with a new customer account, you are delegating account and subscription management to the reseller. This means that the reseller has administrator access to the customer’s subscriptions and services and can manage them on behalf of the customer.

### <a name="add-new-customers-and-associate-them-with-indirect-resellers"></a>Add new customers and associate them with indirect resellers

1.  Select **Indirect resellers** from your **Dashboard** menu. 

2.  Find the indirect reseller that you want to assign new customers to and then select **Add new customer**. Note that the indirect reseller is already selected for you on the customer detail form. Provide the customer’s details and then select **Next: Subscriptions** . 
3.  On the **New subscription** page, select the subscription(s) the customer wants to buy and then enter the number of licenses the customer needs. 

4.  Select **Next: Review**.

5.  If the order is correct, select **Submit**. 如果訂單不正確，請選取 **\[取消\]**以取消整個作業並從頭開始。

6.  提交訂單之後，**\[確認\]** 頁面隨即出現。 **\[安裝資訊\]** 下方會顯示系統管理員使用者帳戶和密碼暫時。 Copy down the user account name and password information so you can send it on to the new customer. 

    >**Important**  Be sure to make a note of the user account name and password as you won’t be able to access this information again after you close this page.

7.  Select **Done**. The new customer appears in your customer list, associated with the indirect reseller. The reseller now has admin access to the customer’s account information and subscriptions and can manage the subscriptions on the customer’s behalf.

### <a name="add-new-subscriptions-to-customer-accounts"></a>Add new subscriptions to customer accounts

When customers want to buy new subscriptions, upgrade existing ones, or buy additional licenses, you make these changes in the customer’s account. 

1.  Select **Customers** from your **Dashboard** menu. 

2.  Find the customer whose account you want to change. You can filter the list by indirect reseller to narrow your choices. Expand the customer’s record by selecting the down arrow, and then selecting **Add subscription**.

3.  On the **New subscription** page, select the subscription(s) and enter the number of licenses the customer wants to purchase. 

4.  To associate the subscription with a reseller, select the reseller’s name from the list and then select **Submit**. Associating the reseller with the subscription enables them to earn incentives, if applicable.

5.  The new subscription(s) appears in the customer’s subscriptions list. 

6.  If you want the reseller to handle customer support requests for the new subscription, select the subscription and then select the reseller from the **Designated support contact** list.

7.  Select **Submit** when finished.
