With regional authorization, partners with international businesses can now more easily manage customers in different regions and countries around the world. This reduces the number of tenants that partners need to manage, reduces the billing dates that partners have to handle, and gives partners a more consolidated view of their sales.

In the past, with the exception of the European Union/EFTA, partners needed to have a physical entity in each country where they wanted to transact. This meant that partners needed to have multiple tenants set up in Partner Center, with multiple billing dates and other settings. In regions such as Latin America, partners were not able to easily work with customers in a neighboring region or country, and in some cases, they were restricted completely.

>**Note**<br> If you are enrolled in [CSP for Microsoft Cloud Germany](partner-center-for-microsoft-cloud-germany.md) and you sell to customers in the EU and EFTA countries/regions, you cannot consolidate your tenant for Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany with your other tenants.  

## <a name="planning"></a>Planning

Partners have multiple options for consolidating their regional tenants, as outlined below.

### <a name="separate-tenants-for-single-regions-or-countries"></a>Separate tenants for single regions or countries

## <a name="consolidating-tenants"></a>Consolidating tenants


If you want to consolidate tenants, we recommend the following:

-   **Multiple regions/countries but only one transacting**. If you are only transacting in one country/region, but have a number of other tenants set up, use the transacting tenant as your new centralized tenant for that region and cancel your other tenants.

-   **Multiple countries/regions but only one Transacting.** If you are transacting in a number of countries/regions, we recommend that you centralize to the tenant with the largest number of seats.
