# <a name="types-of-billing-in-partner-center"></a>Types of billing in Partner Center

適用於：

- 合作夥伴中心
- 雲端解決方案提供者方案中的合作夥伴

You'll be billed for Partner Center purchases depending on the products, solutions and services you buy on behalf of your customers. The types of billing are as follows:

- [**License-based billing**](license-based-billing.md), where you're billed per license (not by license usage).
- [**Usage-based billing**](usage-based-billing.md), where you're billed for monthly usage rates.
- [**Billing for one-time and select recurring charges**](one-time-and-recurring-billing.md), where you pay in advance for a preset term for Microsoft and third-party ISV products.
- Billing for license-based SaaS transactions (see [**common billing scenarios for SaaS charges**](common-billing-scenarios-saas.md)).

根據您為客戶購買的產品類型而定，您可能會有不同的計費週期，並在相同月份的不同日期計費。

If you’ve chosen to be billed monthly or if you’ve bought usage-based products that are billed monthly, your monthly billing date is the day of the month you selected when you created your CSP account on Partner Center. After you’ve successfully created your CSP account, Microsoft will send a confirmation email that includes your billing date. Once created, this date cannot be changed.
