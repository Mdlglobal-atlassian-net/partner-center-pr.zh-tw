**Applies to**

-  Partner Center

As a qualified Microsoft partner, you can receive potential business leads through Partner Center referrals. Manage your incoming leads, respond quickly to those that are a good fit, and skip or decline those that aren’t. Review the types of leads that come in. 

## <a name="referral-management"></a>Referral management

為您執行業務的每個地區，從設定[行銷設定檔](create-a-marketing-profile.md)開始。 Once your profile is active, we’ll be able to direct customers to your business, through:

*  Microsoft marketing activities
*  Internal Microsoft sales and service agents
*  使用**[尋找合作夥伴](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/search)**工具的客戶搜尋。

When a customer is interested in contacting you, they’ll submit a request for information (RFI). 

發生這種情形時，我們將傳送電子郵件給您的所選地區和位置專屬[行銷設定檔](create-a-marketing-profile.md)中所列的連絡人。 您也可以在合作夥伴中心查看傳入 RFI：移至 **\[儀表板\] > \[推薦\] > \[客戶推薦\]**。

Customers often choose to send the same RFI to multiple companies at the same time. To increase your chance of success, we recommend responding to and accepting or declining new referrals within 24 hours or less.

We’ll show you an overview of the RFI. From here, you can decide whether you’re interested in learning more about the referral. 

*  **我有興趣**：我們會將推薦移至 **\[評估中\]**，而且您會看到客戶和優惠完整的詳細資料。 
*  **不，謝謝**：我們會將它封存為 **\[已略過\]**。 We’ll notify the customer to choose a different partner.
*  如果您未在 72 小時內回應，我們會將它封存為 **\[已錯過\]**。 We’ll notify the customer to choose a different partner.

### <a name="evaluating-referrals"></a>Evaluating referrals

Review the details, and contact the customer. Talk to them about their business needs, and determine if you have an offer that can help them. Accept or decline the referral: 

*  **接受**：輸入估計的交易價值，估計的結束日期，然後選取 **\[接受\]**。 We’ll use this information to help you find similar deals. 我們會將推薦移至 **\[交涉中\]**。 This tells us that you plan to actively engage with the customer to address their need.
*  **拒絕**：我們會將它封存為 **\[已拒絕\]**。 We’ll notify the customer to choose a different partner.
*  如果您未在 7 天內回應，我們會將它封存為 **\[已過期\]**。 We’ll notify the customer to choose a different partner.

### <a name="negotiating-referrals"></a>Negotiating referrals

Work to close the deal with the customer. 讓我們知道您贏得或失去交易，我們會將它封存 **\[已成交\]** 或 **\[未成交\]**。 

### <a name="archived-referrals"></a>Archived referrals

隨時檢閱您過去的推薦 (**已成交、未成交、已略過、已錯誤、已拒絕**或**已過期**)。 

## <a name="getting-more-referrals"></a>Getting more referrals

Here’s some tips to help make sure you’re getting more referrals that are appropriate to your business:

*  **針對每一個位置，檢閱您的[行銷設定檔](create-a-marketing-profile.md)中的連絡人資訊**，確定您的小組取得傳入的通知。

*  在您的[行銷設定檔](create-a-marketing-profile.md)中，**選擇關鍵字和喜好設定，表示您的唯一專業和業務模式**。 Remove keywords that would generate referrals for you’re not interested in. If you’re not interested in dealing with businesses of a certain size, update this preference.

*  **快速回應推薦**。 When you respond in a timely fashion to incoming requests, we’ll increase your visibility in future customer search results. Make sure your team responds quickly with your intent.

*  **選擇您接受的交易**。 We monitor the types of deals that you accept and decline, and use this information to help find you similar deals. 

   Accepting deals that aren’t a good fit won’t improve your search results and could impact the quality of the leads you receive.

*  **回報預估的交易大小、結束日期，以及交易的最後狀態**（已成交或未成交）。 We’ll use this info to continue to provide you with quality referrals.
