## <a name="understand-charge-types-in-reconciliation-files"></a>Understand charge types in reconciliation files

To understand the types of charges in reconciliation files (the **ChargeType** column), see [Reconciliation file charge types](recon-file-charge-types.md).

## <a name="fix-formatting-issues"></a>Fix formatting issues

Occasionally, a reconciliation file might contain formatting issues. For example, this issue might occur if the en-US locale is not used.

Follow these steps for fix any formatting issues in your reconciliation files:

1. Open the reconciliation file (in .csv format) in Microsoft Excel.
2. Select the first column in the file.
3. Open the **Convert Text to Columns Wizard**. On the ribbon, select **Data**, then select **Text to Columns**.
4. In the wizard, select **Delimited file type**. Then, select **Next**.
5. In the **Delimiters** field, select **Comma**. (If **Tab** is already selected, you can leave this option selected.) Then, select **Next**.
6. In the **Column data format** field, select **Date:MDY**. Then, select **Next**.
7. In the **Column data format** field, select **Text** for all amount columns. Then, select **Finish**.

## <a name="download-reconciliation-files-programmatically"></a>Download reconciliation files programmatically

Reconciliation files can be very large and are sometimes difficult to download. To download reconciliation files programmatically, see [Get invoice line items](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/get-invoiceline-items).

## <a name="map-taxes-or-vat"></a>Map taxes or VAT

To map Taxes or value-added tax (VAT) to your invoice:

- Sum the **Tax** column from the license-based file.
- Sum the **TaxAmount** column from the usage-based file.

## <a name="itemize-reconciliation-files-by-partner"></a>Itemize reconciliation files by partner

Partners in the **indirect model** can use these additional fields in both license-based and usage-based reconciliation files to itemize the files by reseller.

| MPN 識別碼 | 說明 |
| ------ | ----------- |
| MPN 識別碼 | The Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) identifier of the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner (direct or indirect). |
| [Reseller MPN ID](#reseller-mpn-id) | The [MPN identifier of the reseller of record for the subscription](#reseller-mpn-id). This field corresponds to the reseller ID listed for the specific subscription in Partner Center. 只會出現在間接模型合作夥伴的對帳檔案上。 |

### <a name="reseller-mpn-id"></a>經銷商 MPN 識別碼

If a CSP partner sold the subscription directly to the customer, their **MPN ID** is listed twice, as both the **MPN ID** and the **Reseller MPN ID**.

If a CSP partner has a reseller with no **MPN ID**, this value is set to the partner's **MPN ID** instead.

If the CSP partner removes a **Reseller MPN ID**, this value will be set to *-1*.

To view or update the **Reseller MPN ID**:

1. 登入合作夥伴中心。
2. 在 \[合作夥伴中心\] 功能表中，選取 **\[客戶\]** 。
3. 從清單中選擇客戶。
4. In the customer menu, select **Subscriptions**.
5. Choose the subscription from the list.
6. 選取 \[更新\] 以變更 \[經銷商 (MPN 識別碼)\]。
