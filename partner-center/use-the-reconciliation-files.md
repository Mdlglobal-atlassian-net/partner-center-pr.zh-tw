# <a name="use-the-reconciliation-files"></a>Use the reconciliation files

**Applies to**

-  Partner Center
-  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government
-  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany

For a detailed line-item view of each charge in a billing cycle, download the reconciliation files from the Partner Center dashboard. The details include charges for each customer's subscriptions, and detailed events (such as a mid-term addition of seats to a subscription).

## <a href="" id="itemizebypartner"></a>Itemize by partner


Partners in the indirect model can use these additional fields in both license-based and usage-based reconciliation files to itemize by reseller.

<td>Reseller MPN ID</td>
<td><p>Only appears on reconciliation files for partners in the indirect model.</p>
<p>The MPN ID of the reseller of record for the subscription. This corresponds to the reseller ID listed for the specific subscription in Partner Center.</p>
<p>eTo view or update the reseller, in the Partner Center menu, select <strong>Customers</strong>, then choose the customer from the list. In the customer menu, select <strong>Subscriptions</strong>, choose the subscription from the list. Select <strong>update</strong> to change the <strong>Reseller (MPN ID)</strong>.</p>
<p>If a CSP partner sold the subscription directly to the customer, their MPN ID is listed twice, as both the MPN ID and the Reseller MPN ID.</p>
<p>If a CSP partner has a reseller with no MPN ID, this value is set to the partner’s MPN ID instead.</p>
<p>If the CSP partner removes a reseller ID, this value will be set to -1.</p></td>

## <a href="" id="charge_types"></a>對應發票和對帳檔案之間的費用

Your invoice provides a summary of charges, while your reconciliation file provides a detailed breakdown of line-item transactions, including charge types.

To cross-reference charge amounts between the invoice and reconciliation file, you can use Microsoft Excel's filter options to filter by charge types on the reconciliation file to map the invoice charges to a set of charge breakdowns on reconciliation file.

The table below shows the mappings between an invoice section and associated charge types that might show up on the reconciliation files.
