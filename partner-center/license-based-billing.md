When you buy products or online services in Partner Center that require **licenses**, you’re billed *for each license* that you buy. You're *not billed* by usage for these licenses. (For information on usage-based billing and other billing types, see [Types of billing in Partner Center](billing-different-types.md).)

## <a name="license-billing-frequency"></a>License billing frequency

You can choose to be billed for licenses once a month (**monthly billing**) or once a year (**annual billing**). For more information about **billing frequency**, see [Monthly and annual billing differences](billing-annual-monthly.md).

## <a name="billing-date-for-licenses"></a>Billing date for licenses

License-based subscriptions are billed in advance on the subscription's **anniversary date**. The anniversary date is the day of the month that you purchased the subscription.

例如：

- If you purchased a **monthly subscription** on January 15th, the anniversary date will be the 15th of each month.
- If you purchased an **annual subscription** on January 15th, the anniversary date will be January 15th of each year.

## <a name="license-term"></a>License term

All license-based subscriptions have a 12-month paid term, which begins on the purchase date.

## <a name="license-cancellation"></a>License cancellation

You can cancel a license at any point during the [license term](#license-term). However, the month in which you cancel impacts how much credit you will receive for the cancelled license.

If you suspend a subscription in month 1, you will be credited 100%.

If you suspend a subscription in months 2-12, you will be credited on a prorated basis.

## <a name="license-renewal"></a>License renewal

All license-based subscriptions auto-renew 12-months after the paid term begins.
