title: Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany
description: Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany is the business portal for Microsoft partners who want to offer Microsoft cloud solutions to customers in EU and EFTA countries. Microsoft Cloud Germany ensures that your customer data resides in Germany and a designated German data trustee controls access to it. Commercial customers in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can store and manage customer data in compliance with applicable German laws and regulations as well as key international standards. Microsoft cannot access customer data without approval from and supervision by the German data trustee or customer.
