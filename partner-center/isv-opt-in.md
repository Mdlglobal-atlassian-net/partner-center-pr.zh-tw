# <a name="marketplace-exclusive-offers"></a>Marketplace exclusive offers

ISVs have the option of making their offers available to a select number of CSP partners. All CSP partners will still be able to view all ISV offers in the Partner Center Marketplace but offers marked Exclusive will only be able to be purchased by the partners who the ISV has selected. If an offer is not indicated as “Exclusive” all partners can purchase it.

CSP partners who are identified by ISVs can:

- Purchase exclusive offers through Partner Center marketplace
- Export price list

When an ISV publishes an offer on the Marketplace, they have the opportunity to indicate who can purchase it. 

Their options are:

- All CSP partners can purchase
- Determine which partners can purchase
- Not available to CSP partners
