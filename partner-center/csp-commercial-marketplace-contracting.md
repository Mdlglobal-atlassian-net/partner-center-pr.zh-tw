This section relates to contracts for partners in the CSP program who choose to purchase ISV marketplace offers or products for their customers from the Partner Center commercial marketplace or the Azure portal.

The [CSP Program Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617100) contains the terms and conditions governing commercial marketplace offers between Microsoft and partners in the CSP program. CSP partners should review these terms and conditions to ensure they are operating in compliance within the program.  

If partners have already signed their CSP agreements, they do not need to re-sign in order to sell commercial marketplace offers. Applicable CSP agreements include the current Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) and the prior Microsoft Cloud Reseller Agreement (MCRA) or Microsoft Cloud Distributor Agreement (MCDA).

>[!NOTE]
> Certain commercial marketplace offers may require additional agreements between the partner in the CSP program, the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) and/or the customer. It is the ISV's responsibility to provide the customer with the appropriate Customer Agreement associated with each ISV offer ordered by that customer.

For more information about terms governing CSP activities in the commercial marketplace, see:

- **Section 5.7 (Third Party Offers)** in the [CSP Program Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617100). This provides the terms that govern the sale of ISV solutions by partners in the CSP program.

- **The Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)** will govern the CSP program, replacing the existing MCRA and MCDA. The MPA is available on [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/dashboard/overview) so that partners who choose to participate in the CSP program can review and accept it.
  
Microsoft does not accept legal responsibility for delivery of services between transacting parties and does not provide a mechanism for transacting partners to establish legal terms through its commerce platform. If the transacting partners require additional legal terms, they will need to execute an agreement directly.
