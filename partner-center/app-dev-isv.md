If you attained the now-retired ISV competency and one of the following scenarios applies to you, we are offering your company a one-time exam requirements exemption for the gold or silver [Application Development competency](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/application-development-competency). 

Partners with an ISV competency:

- **Your ISV competency has expired** – your one-time exam requirements exemption will be available in Partner Center starting November 22, 2019. You will have 30 days to take advantage of the offer. 

- **Your competency membership is in its renewal window** – your one-time exam requirements exemption will be available in Partner Center starting November 22, 2019. You will have 30 days to take advantage of the offer. 

- **Your competency membership is due for renewal in the coming months** – your one-time exam requirements exemption will be available to you when it’s time to renew. At that time, you will have 30 days to get the offer.

Partners with an Application Development competency attained via the cert IP path:

- **If you have a Microsoft commercial marketplace listing**, your one-time exam requirements exemption will be available at the time of your competency renewal. At that time, you will have 30 days to take advantage of the offer.

- **If you do not have a [Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/commercial-marketplace/) listing**, publish your solution by February 2020 to be eligible for the one-time exam requirements exemption.
