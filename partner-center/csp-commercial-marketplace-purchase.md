As a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, you can use the commercial marketplace to purchase subscriptions for your customers to certain Software as a Service (SaaS) products offered by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). 

By offering ISV SaaS subscriptions to your customers, you can help differentiate your business. You can also give your customers access to software bundles that address their specific business needs. You manage licenses and subscriptions for these marketplace SaaS products from ISV publishers just as you manage licenses and subscriptions for Microsoft products.

You can purchase either **license-based** SaaS subscriptions or **usage-based** subscriptions. To learn more about the difference between license-based and usage-based billing, see [Billing basics](billing-basics.md).

You purchase subscriptions for license-based SaaS products offered by ISV publishers using the same process you use to purchase subscriptions for Microsoft products.

To purchase a license-based SaaS subscription in Partner Center, see [Create, suspend or cancel customer subscriptions](create-a-new-subscription.md#create-a-new-subscription).

您也可以使用[合作夥伴中心 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/) 來為您的客戶建立商業市集訂用帳戶。 (For more info on using Partner Center APIs, see [Create a subscription for commercial marketplace products](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/create-subscription-azure-marketplace-products).)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> As a partner in the CSP program, you can only purchase **license-based** SaaS subscriptions from ISV publishers within Partner Center. This means you can purchase any **license-based** SaaS offer the ISV publisher has made available to you, including [exclusive offers](csp-commercial-marketplace-discover.md#learn-about-marketplace-exclusive-offers) to which you have access. To purchase or manage other, commercial marketplace offers from ISVs (such as **usage-based**, metered or consumption-based offers involving Azure applications, Containers or VMs), you must go to the [Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For more information, see the following topic.

## <a name="purchase-usage-based-subscriptions-in-the-azure-management-portal"></a>Purchase usage-based subscriptions in the Azure management portal

In contrast to license-based SaaS subscriptions from third-party ISV publishers, usage-based subscriptions first require a customer to have an Azure subscription. Billing for commercial marketplace, usage-based resources falls under the customer's Azure subscription. Once your customer has an Azure subscription, a partner in the CSP program can follow these steps to purchase a commercial marketplace subscription for them:

1. Sign into the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard), then select **Customers** from the left-hand menu.

2. Select the specific customer, then select **Subscriptions**.  

3. Under the **Usage-based subscriptions**, select **All resources**. This takes you to the Azure Management portal.

4. In the Azure Management portal, select **Create a resource** from the left-hand menu.

5. Select **See all** at the top of the Azure Marketplace list.

6. To narrow your list, use filters at the top of the Marketplace list. For example, you can select **Microsoft** or **Partner** from the **Publisher** dropdown list to view only offers from Microsoft or those from an ISV publisher.

7. Choose a specific offer, then select **Create**.
